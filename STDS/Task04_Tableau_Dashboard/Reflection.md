# Revised Reflection on Task 04: Tableau Visualizations for Employee Data

This task revolved around the creation and deployment of an interactive data visualization dashboard using Tableau. The primary data source for this endeavor was the `Employee.csv` file, which supplied the necessary information for generating various insightful visualizations. These visualizations were designed to illustrate aspects such as workforce demographics, departmental allocations, and performance indicators. The final Tableau dashboard (`Dashboard.twb`) offers an intuitive platform for stakeholders to delve into employee data, discern underlying trends, and derive actionable human resource insights.
