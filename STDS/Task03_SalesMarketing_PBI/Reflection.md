# Revised Reflection on Task 03: Sales & Marketing Power BI Analytics

The core objective of this task was the development of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for in-depth sales and marketing analysis. This initiative required amalgamating various data inputs, ranging from product and shipping method CSVs (`Product.csv`, `ShipMethod.csv`) to pre-rendered visual assets (`customer_analysis.png`, `executive_summary.png`, `marketing_conversion.png`, `sales_product_analysis.png`) and essential geographical data (`map_json_countries.json`). The dashboard's design prioritizes visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to market trends, campaign efficacy, and customer behavior, all intended to bolster strategic planning.
