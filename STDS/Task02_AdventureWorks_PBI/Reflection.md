# Revised Reflection on Task 02: AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboarding

This project was dedicated to constructing a dynamic Power BI dashboard for the AdventureWorks enterprise. The process encompassed integrating diverse data sources, including executing SQL queries (as seen in `Sql_Task.sql`) and importing CSV files such as `SalesTerritory.csv` and `SalesView.csv`, to forge a robust data model. The resulting Power BI dashboard is engineered to offer interactive visual reports on critical aspects like sales performance, customer metrics, and geographical distribution, thereby facilitating more informed business decisions.
